## ▶️ How It Works

### 1. Camera + AR Overlay

The app accesses the device camera and overlays navigation arrows/path indicators directly on-screen.

### 2. Indoor Map + Position Tracking

A map or coordinate system of the building is used to determine the user’s current position and route.

### 3. AR Path Visualization

The system renders step-by-step AR markers that guide the user through hallways and intersections.

### 4. Dynamic Recalculation

If the user deviates, PathFindAR recalculates and updates the AR path seamlessly.
